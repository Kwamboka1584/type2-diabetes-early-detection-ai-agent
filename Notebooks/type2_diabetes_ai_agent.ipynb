    "This project aims to build an AI-driven early detection system for Type 2 Diabetes using NHANES datasets (2013–2018) and supporting external data sources.  \n",
    "The goal is to create a robust, interpretable, and deployable model that can help identify individuals at high risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes at an early stage.\n"

    "## Step 2: Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Introduction & Context\n",
    "Type 2 Diabetes is a growing public health crisis across Africa and particularly in Kenya. According to the **International Diabetes Federation (IDF)**, more than **24 million adults in Africa** currently live with diabetes, a figure projected to rise to **55 million by 2045** as lifestyles change and urbanization accelerates :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  \n",
    "In Kenya, adult prevalence is estimated at **~ 3.1%**, which translates to about **813,300 adults aged 20–79** living with diabetes :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 The Situation in Kenya\n",
    "Despite these numbers, awareness and testing remain critically low:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Around **40% of Kenyans with diabetes are unaware** of their condition.  \n",
    "- More than **88% of Kenyans have never had their blood sugar tested** (STEPS survey, 2015).  \n",
    "- Officially, about **800,000 people have been diagnosed** with diabetes in Kenya.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These facts imply that a large population is at risk of undiagnosed or late-diagnosed diabetes, which leads to complications like cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness, and adds large economic burdens.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Here’s a chart from the WHO fact sheet showing current numbers and projections:\n",

    "### 2.3 Problem Statement\n",
    "How can we build a predictive AI system, tailored to the Kenyan and East African population, that **identifies individuals at high risk for Type 2 Diabetes early**—before complications arise—so that intervention is timely, cost-effective, and scalable?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Objectives\n",
    "1. **Early Risk Identification**  \n",
    "   Develop a predictive model with strong recall/sensitivity to capture undiagnosed cases, helping reduce the large fraction of people who are unaware of their condition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Public Health & Clinical Impact**  \n",
    "   - Support Kenya’s healthcare system in early detection and prevention.  \n",
    "   - Provide region-specific risk factor insights (e.g., obesity, hypertension, diet, physical inactivity).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AI Agent Deployment**  \n",
    "   Deliver not just a model, but a deployable tool that can be integrated into Kenyan/East African health initiatives for self-assessment and screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Success Metrics\n",
    "- **Model performance:** High recall (≥ 80%), balanced F1, strong ROC-AUC.  \n",
    "- **Social impact:** Decrease undiagnosed cases (currently large in Kenya) through earlier screening and awareness.  \n",
    "- **Operational:** Tool must be usable in low-resource environments, cost-effective, scalable.\n",
