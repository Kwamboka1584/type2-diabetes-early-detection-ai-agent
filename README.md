## Background
Type 2 Diabetes is a growing global health concern that can lead to severe complications if undiagnosed or untreated.  
Early prediction enables:
- **Timely medical interventions**
- **Lifestyle adjustments**
- **Cost reduction for healthcare systems**

This project leverages real-world health survey data to **predict diabetes risk** and identify key factors that drive the disease.

## Project Objectives
1. **Analyze** lifestyle and health-related features to uncover risk patterns.
2. **Build** machine learning models to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.
3. **Evaluate** models for accuracy, interpretability, and real-world applicability.
4. **Recommend** preventive measures based on findings.

## Data Understanding
- **Source:** Public health survey dataset (cleaned for analysis).
- **Target Variable:** Presence of Type 2 Diabetes (binary classification).
- **Features:** Demographics (age, gender), lifestyle (physical activity, smoking), and clinical metrics (BMI, cholesterol check, blood pressure).

**Key Data Insights:**
- Imbalanced target distribution: Fewer positive diabetes cases.
- Strong correlations between **BMI**, **Age**, **Cholesterol Check**, and diabetes status.
- Lifestyle habits like **physical inactivity** and **smoking** show moderate association.
